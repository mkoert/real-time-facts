# Real-Time Facts

A promotional project showcasing full-stack software engineering skills.

**Disclaimer:** The facts displayed in this application may or may not be true. They were auto-generated by an AI model, and more will be added using the same process.

## Purpose

This project demonstrates proficiency in building modern web applications, including:

- **Backend API** — Node.js + Express with REST endpoints and WebSocket support
- **Database** — MongoDB for data persistence
- **Web Frontend** — React application consuming the API
- **Data Generator** — Service that sends facts to the backend for real-time distribution
- **Infrastructure** — Docker Compose orchestration with Nginx reverse proxy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Running with Docker

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost`.

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run backend
npm run dev:backend

# Run frontend
npm run dev:frontend

# Run data generator
npm run dev:generator
```

### Native App (Expo)

```bash
cd native

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Expo development server
npm start

# Or run directly on a platform
npm run ios      # iOS Simulator
npm run android  # Android Emulator
npm run web      # Web browser
```

Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your device, or press `i` for iOS Simulator / `a` for Android Emulator.
